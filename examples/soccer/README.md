## ‚öΩ datasets

Original data comes from the [DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout) 
Kaggle competition. This data has been processed to create new datasets, which can be 
downloaded from the [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

## ü§ñ models

- [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) (Player Detection) - Detects 
players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball in the video.
- [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) (Pitch Detection) - Identifies 
the soccer field boundaries and key points.
- [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/siglip) - Extracts 
features from image crops of players.
- [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Reduces the dimensionality of 
the extracted features for easier clustering.
- [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) - 
Clusters the reduced-dimension features to classify players into two teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è modes

- `PITCH_DETECTION` - Detects the soccer field boundaries and key points in the video. 
Useful for identifying and visualizing the layout of the soccer pitch.

  ```bash
  python main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-pitch-detection.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode PITCH_DETECTION
  ```

  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf4df75a-89fe-4c6f-b3dc-e4d63a0ed211

- `PLAYER_DETECTION` - Detects players, goalkeepers, referees, and the ball in the 
video. Essential for identifying and tracking the presence of players and other 
entities on the field.

  ```bash
  python main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-player-detection.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode PLAYER_DETECTION
  ```

  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c36ea2c1-b03e-4ffe-81bd-27391260b187

- `BALL_DETECTION` - Detects the ball in the video frames and tracks its position. 
Useful for following ball movements throughout the match.

  ```bash
  python main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-ball-detection.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode BALL_DETECTION
  ```

  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd83678-7790-4f4d-a8c0-065ef38ca031

- `PLAYER_TRACKING` - Tracks players across video frames, maintaining consistent 
identification. Useful for following player movements and positions throughout the 
match.

  ```bash
  python main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-player-tracking.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode PLAYER_TRACKING
  ```
  
  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69be83ac-52ff-4879-b93d-33f016feb839

- `TEAM_CLASSIFICATION` - Classifies detected players into their respective teams based 
on their visual features. Helps differentiate between players of different teams for 
analysis and visualization.

  ```bash
  python main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-team-classification.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode TEAM_CLASSIFICATION
  ```

  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/239c2960-5032-415c-b330-3ddd094d32c7

- `RADAR` - Combines pitch detection, player detection, tracking, and team 
classification to generate a radar-like visualization of player positions on the 
soccer field. Provides a comprehensive overview of player movements and team formations 
on the field.

  ```bash
  python main.py --source_video_path data/2e57b9_0.mp4 \
  --target_video_path data/2e57b9_0-radar.mp4 \
  --device mps --mode RADAR
  ```

## üó∫Ô∏è roadmap

- [ ] Add smoothing to eliminate flickering in RADAR mode.
- [ ] Add a notebook demonstrating how to save data and perform offline data analysis.

This demo integrates two main components, each with its own licensing:

- ultralytics: The object detection model used in this demo, YOLOv8, is distributed 
under the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/LICENSE).
- sports: The analytics code that powers the sports analysis in this demo is based on 
the [Supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision) library, which is licensed 
under the [MIT license](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/blob/develop/LICENSE.md). 
This makes the sports part of the code fully open source and freely usable in your 
projects.
